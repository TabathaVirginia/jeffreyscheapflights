This site, named in honor our our beloved friend Jeffrey Young, allows users to select a day on which to fly from one US airport to another. If a flight record exists, they have the option to buy a ticket after which a seat is automatically selected for them. They can view tickets that they have purchased at any time by access the My Tickets page where they can also make notes about airlines that they do or do not like.
